When you're not sure what TODO...

The idea of wikitodos is very simple: ready-made TODOs & checklists. Do you want to cook Spaghetti, or go to the beach? 

There must be a TODO about that. 

This is my first Symfony Project. Actually, the whole point of this project is to learn & touch Symfony features, so there are a lot of improvements that could be made.
